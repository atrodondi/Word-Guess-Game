# Word-Guess-Game
The point of the game is just like HangMan- guess the single word Movie Title before you run out of Guesses. Picking a correct letter does not use up a guesses.

When the user wins, they get a win added to their screen and a choice if they want to continue or not. If the user loses, they play again.
